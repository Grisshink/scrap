                <p class="q"><strong>Q:</strong> Is it any better than something like Snap?</p>
                <p class="a"><strong>A:</strong> In its current state, no, but there are several features planned which will make it more comparable to these advanced coding platforms
                    (like native compilation, static typing, first class functions, multithreading, graphics, etc.)

            <article class="qa">
                <p class="q"><strong>Q:</strong> Why GPLv3 when there are better licenses for that?</p>
                <p class="a"><strong>A:</strong> I did this mostly because Scratch and TurboWarp are endorsing open source (with the former even being licensed with AGPL), so I'm also endorsing that.
                    The main plan now is to split up a project into an editor part (which will still be GPLv3) and a library/compiler part
                    (which will be licensed more permissively). This should in theory resolve most of the licensing issues in future.

                <p class="q"><strong>Q:</strong> Any plans for mobile support?</p>
                <p class="a"><strong>A:</strong> Not at all. The UI was not designed with mobile features in mind, so I will not work on the mobile port any time soon.
                    Unofficial ports are still welcome, though.
