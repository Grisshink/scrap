/**
 * @file  cfgpath.h
 * @brief Cross platform methods for obtaining paths to configuration files.
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2013 Adam Nielsen <malvineous@shikadi.net>
 *
 * This code is placed in the public domain.  You are free to use it for any
 * purpose.  If you add new platform support, please contribute a patch!
 *
 * Example use:
 *
 * char cfgdir[256];
 * get_user_config_file(cfgdir, sizeof(cfgdir), "myapp");
 * if (cfgdir[0] == 0) {
 *     printf("Unable to find home directory.\n");
 *     return 1;
 * }
 * printf("Saving configuration file to %s\n", cfgdir);
 *
 * A number of constants are also defined:
 *
 *  - MAX_PATH: Maximum length of a path, in characters.  Used to allocate a
 *      char array large enough to hold the returned path.
 *
 *  - PATH_SEPARATOR_CHAR: The separator between folders.  This will be either a
 *      forward slash or a backslash depending on the platform.  This is a
 *      character constant.
 *
 *  - PATH_SEPARATOR_STRING: The same as PATH_SEPARATOR_CHAR but as a C string,
 *      to make it easier to append to other string constants.

/** Get an absolute path to a single configuration file, specific to this user.

 * This function is useful for programs that need only a single configuration

 *
 * Output is typically:
 *
 *   Windows: C:\Users\jcitizen\AppData\Roaming\appname.ini
 *   Linux: /home/jcitizen/.config/appname.conf
 *   Mac: /Users/jcitizen/Library/Application Support/appname.conf
 *
 * @param out
 *   Buffer to write the path.  On return will contain the path, or an empty
 *   string on error.
 *
 * @param maxlen
 *   Length of out.  Must be >= MAX_PATH.
 *
 * @param appname
 *   Short name of the application.  Avoid using spaces or version numbers, and
 *   use lowercase if possible.
 *
 * @post The file may or may not exist.
 * @post The folder holding the file is created if needed.

 *
 * The returned path will always end in a platform-specific trailing slash, so
 * that a filename can simply be appended to the path.

 *
 * This path should be used for persistent, important data files the user would
